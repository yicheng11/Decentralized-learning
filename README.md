# Decentralized-learning
Implementation of Reinforcement based Communication Topology Construction for Decentralized Learning with Non-IID Data
# Requirements:
* Python 3.7
* pytorch=1.2.0
# How to run?
```shell=
python run.py --config=config.json
```
* `--config` (`-c`): path to the configuration file to be used.

`config.json` files

We use a JSON file to manage the configuration parameters for decentralized learning simulation.
